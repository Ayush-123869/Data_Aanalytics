📊 Visualization Objectives
The visualizations aim to:

Track Year-wise Threat Volume: Show trends from 2015–2024 in reported incidents.

Compare Industry Attacks: Identify which sectors (e.g., Finance, Healthcare, IT) are most targeted.

Visualize Attack Vectors: Breakdown of phishing, malware, DDoS, insider threats, etc.

Display Incident Heatmaps: Geographic distribution of major threats.

Analyze Mitigation Trends: How response strategies evolved over time.
🧭 How to Interact with the Dashboard
Dropdown Filters: Select year range, industry, and attack type to filter charts dynamically.

Hover Tooltips: Hover over graphs to see detailed information on each data point.

Zoom & Pan: Use mouse/trackpad to zoom into timelines or geographical heatmaps.

Export Options: Download filtered charts for presentations or reports.
